> An `awesome` theme.

Main agenda is to use this as a template for my notes, which will be made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Why Obsidian

Well, I looked at it and fell in love with it. Also, because of it's graph view.


```bash
    snap install --dangerous <obsidian-pkg>
```

Apparently snapd doesn't let you install unsigned packages easily, and that's very thoughtfull of them.
